    "These are called compound data types and are one of the key types of data structures in Python. Tuples. Tuples are an ordered sequence. Here is a tuple ratings. Tuples are expressed as comma separated elements within parentheses. These are values inside the parentheses. In Python, there are different types: strings, integer, float. They can all be contained in a tuple but the type of the variable is **tuple**.\n",

    "We can concatenate or combine tuples by adding them. The result is the following with the following index. If we would like multiple elements from a tuple, we could also slice tuples. For example, if we want the first three elements we use the following command. The last index is one larger than the index you want; similarly if we want the last two elements, we use the following command.\n",
    "Notice, how the last index is one larger than the length of the tuple.We can use the len command to obtain the length of a tuple. As there are five elements, the result is 5.\n",

    "Tuples are immutable which means we can't change them. As a consequence of immutability, if we would like to manipulate a tuple we must create a new tuple instead. "
