    "These are called compound data types and are one of the key types of data structures in Python. Tuples. Tuples are an ordered sequence. Here is a tuple ratings. Tuples are expressed as comma separated elements within parentheses. These are values inside the parentheses. In Python, there are different types: strings, integer, float. They can all be contained in a tuple but the type of the variable is **tuple**.\n",

    "Dictionaries are a type of collection in Python. If you recall, a list is integer indexes. These are like addresses. A list also has elements. A dictionary has keys and values. The key is analogous to the index. They are like addresses, but they don't have to be integers. They are usually characters. The values are similar to the element in a list and contain information.\n",

    "Let's go over set operations. These could be used to change the set. Consider the set A. Let's represent this set with a circle. If you are familiar with sets, this could be part of a venn diagram. A venn diagram is a tool that uses shapes usually to represent sets. We can add an item to a set using the add-method. We just put the set name followed by a dot, then the add-method. The argument is the new element of the set we would like to add, in this case, NSYNC. The set A now has in NSYNC as an item. If we add the same item twice, nothing will happen as there can be no duplicates in a set. Let's say we would like to remove NSYNC from set A. We can also remove an item from a set using the remove-method. We just put the set name followed by a dot, then the remove-method. The argument is the element of the set we would like to remove, in this case, NSYNC. After the remove-method is applied to the set, set A does not contain the item NSYNC. You can use this method for any item in the set. We can verify if an element is in the set using the in command as follows. The command checks that the item, in this case AC/DC, is in the set. If the item is in the set, it returns true. If we look for an item that is not in the set, in this case for the item Who, adds the item is not in the set, we will get a false.

    "There are other operations we can do. There are lots of useful mathematical operations we can do between sets. Let's define the set album set one. We can represent it using a red circle or venn diagram. Similarly, we can define the set album set two. We can also represent it using a blue circle or venn diagram. The intersection of two sets is a new set containing elements which are in both of those sets. It's helpful to use venn diagrams. The two circles that represent the sets combine, the overlap, represents the new set. As the overlap is comprised with the red circle and blue circle, we define the intersection in terms of and. In Python, we use an ampersand to find the intersection of the two sets. If we overlay the values of the set over the circle placing the common elements in the overlapping area, we see the correspondence. After applying the intersection operation, all the items that are not in both sets disappear. In Python, we simply just place the ampersand between the two sets. We see that both AC/DC and Back in Black are in both sets. The result is a new set album: set three containing all the elements in both albums set one and album set two. The union of two sets is the new set of elements which contain all the items in both sets.\n",
